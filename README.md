## Project Title
**StorylineProgress**

## Project Description
StorylineProgress is a smart contract built on the Ethereum blockchain to track and reward users' progression through a series of unlockable story chapters. Each chapter unlocks rewards for users, which can be claimed in ETH. The contract is designed to integrate seamlessly with educational or entertainment platforms, providing a transparent and secure method for tracking progress and distributing rewards.

## Project Vision
The vision of StorylineProgress is to create an engaging and transparent mechanism for incentivizing learning and interaction. By leveraging blockchain technology, the project ensures that rewards and progress tracking are immutable, fair, and decentralized. This system can be used in gamified learning environments, interactive storytelling platforms, or educational tools to encourage user engagement.

## Key Features

### 1. Owner-Controlled Chapter Unlocking
- Only the contract owner can unlock chapters for users.
- Unlocking a chapter awards the user with a predefined reward.

### 2. Reward Claiming
- Users can claim their accumulated rewards in ETH directly from the contract.
- The system ensures only valid rewards can be claimed.

### 3. Transparent Event Tracking
- Events (`ChapterUnlocked` and `RewardClaimed`) are emitted for each key action, ensuring transparency and ease of off-chain integration.

### 4. Ether-Compatible
- The contract can receive Ether to fund user rewards, ensuring a straightforward reward mechanism.

### 5. Robust Validation
- Chapters must be unlocked in sequence, and rewards are calculated based on progress, ensuring a fair system for all users.
